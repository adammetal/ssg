# Json Data Format

What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data exchange format. It is a collection of key-value pairs where the key must be a string type, and the value can be of any of the following types:

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- null

A couple of important rules to note:

In the JSON data format, the keys must be enclosed in double quotes.
The key and value must be separated by a colon (:) symbol.
There can be multiple key-value pairs. Two key-value pairs must be separated by a comma (,) symbol.
No comments (// or /* */) are allowed in JSON data. (But you can get around that, if you're curious.)
